# Create your Upsun account

The extension in order to work is leveraging the Upsun CLI [learn more](https://docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.html). This extension will be providing you all commands to manage your subscription and your project, from adding new user to your organization, to triggering redeployment of your project etc.

But in order to use it, you must first have an Upsun user account.

If you donâ€™t already have one, register for a trial account. You can sign up with an email address or an existing **GitHub**, **Bitbucket**, or **Google account**. If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun account later.

To create one you can follow this link: [create user account](https://auth.upsun.com/?).
